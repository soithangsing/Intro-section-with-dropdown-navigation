### What I learned

The way I started out this project is not quite right. I started by laying out the desktop site which soon became a pain in the ass as I redesigned it for mobile. 

I need to lay out a structure for how I begin these projects.

I made the mobile layout anyhow. I was thinking of making the drop down with JavaScript, right now it's only with CSS so there's an annoying problem that the menu closes as soon as we hover out of the anchor. This happens because the hover is not detected outside the bounds of the element, which can probably be fixed by adding a class of 'active' and making the drop downs behave like modals. 

Making the collapsible sidebar with rotating icon is probably one of the harder things that is making me procrastinate completing this project, nevertheless, it will be done. *I did not do it*

This project has taken me about 2 weeks. Probably the longest that any project has taken me. Also it's not finished completely because I want to continue with further projects and finish them faster. I had to battle with a great deal of procrastination to get here. 

### Continued development

For future I would like to focus on laying out a template to follow for all project work. 

I would like to learn how to make my designs mobile-first. 

I would like to get a project done quickly but without compromise. 

I would like to further brush up on my CSS and JavaScript skills.
