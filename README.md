# Intro-section-with-dropdown-navigation

The way I started out this project is not quite right. I started by laying out the desktop site which soon became a pain in the ass as I'm redesigning it for mobile. 

I need to lay out a structure for how I begin these projects.

I made the mobile layout anyhow. I was thinking of making the drop down with JavaScript, right now it's only with CSS so there's an annoying problem that the menu closes as soon as we hover out of the anchor. 

Making the collapsible sidebar with rotating icon is probably one of the harder things that is making me procrastinate completing this project, nevertheless, it will be done.
